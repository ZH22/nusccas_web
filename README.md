## Project Overview
### Context
Part of Orbital NUS 2025, a self-driven programming summer experience, undertaken in the first year by Computer Science students in the National University of Singapore.

### Problem
Coming in as a freshman, the starting few weeks are usually pretty exciting and hectic, with many decisions surrounding Module Planning, Accommodation administration, Orientation Events, leaving CCAs (Co-Curricular Activities) as an afterthought. Weâ€™d argue that it may be due to the friction of sourcing, researching and applying for CCAs that deter many, potentially leaving CCAs obscured from potential interested parties.
### Aim
We hope to provide a One-Stop, Easy-to-Use and Personalised web application to help NUS students find CCAs and Student Life Events just for them.
